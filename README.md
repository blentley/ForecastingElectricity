## Project Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to share with you my workflow initial attempt at predicting electricity demand for the NSW National Energy Market (NEM) region.  
  
This readme will give a flavour for the process I have undertaken to model this demand as it's a simplification of the detail in the full version. The full suite of scripts are also available in this repository and I will make reference to them in the text below.
  
### Project Motivations
*Why did I choose the electricity market in Australia?*  
+ The energy sector is undergoing some major transformation after years of political bickering and little action. The private sector and consumers are becoming increasingly anxious about our energy future as energy prices continue to rise above broader inflation. That means there's something major happening in the news related to the energy market every few days. When I think about career pathways, I could see myself possibly working in this industry.  
+ I'm passionate about renewable energy, climate change and environmentalism so I wanted to understand more about how the market operates.  
  
### The National Energy Market (NEM)  
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) makes a number of short and long term forecasts for effective business planning and investment decisions. This project will focus on their short term 5 minute dispatch forecast.  

### Some important details
 The main tools I have used for this analysis are:  
 + Python 3.6, including the following libraries  
 	+ pandas  
 	+ plotly  
 	+ keras with tensorflow as the backend
 + PostgreSQL 9.6.1  
  
This analysis will focus on the NSW NEM region and air temperature at Bankstown Airport (chosen for its somewhat geographical 'average' of Sydney, NSW)

## Understanding the data  
The datasets I have used are quite straightforward. They are:  
+ Demand *(source: AEMO)*  
	+ Settlement date - *settlementdate (timestamp)* - dispatch settlement timestamp observed in 5 minute frequencies  
	+ NEM region - *regionid (character)* - identifier of NEM region  
	+ Demand - *totaldemand (numeric)* - demand for electricity measured in megawatts (MW)  
  
A sample of this data is available in SampleData/Demand.csv  

+ Air temperature *(source: Bureau of Meterology)*  
	+ Time - *index (timestamp)* - air temperature observation timestamp observed in 30 minute frequencies  
	+ Weather Station identifier - *station_id* (character)* - An ID code to identify weather stations around the country  
	+ Temperature - *air_temp (numeric)* - Air temperature measured in degrees Celsius  
  
A sample of this data is available in SampleData/Temperature.csv  
It's worth noting that the air temperature data will not arrive in a clean format as above. Each weather station's data will be in its own file and the usual cleansing, formatting and gap-filling will be needed.  

The scripts where I've loaded raw demand and climate data into PostgreSQL can be found in Scripts/LoadDemand.ipynb and Scripts/LoadClimate.ipynb respectively. I've also included equivalent HTML outputs
