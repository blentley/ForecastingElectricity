## Project Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to share with you my workflow initial attempt at predicting electricity demand using a LSTM neural network for the NSW National Energy Market (NEM) region. After reading about the successes other applications had achieved using LSTMs for sequence type predictions, I was keen to give them a try on this time series problem.  
  
This readme will give a flavour for the process I have undertaken to model this demand as it's a simplification of the detail in the full version. The full suite of scripts are also available in this repository and I will make reference to them in the text below.
  
### Project Motivations
*Why did I choose the electricity market in Australia?*  
+ The energy sector is undergoing some major transformation after years of political bickering and little action. The private sector and consumers are becoming increasingly anxious about our energy future as energy prices continue to rise above broader inflation. That means there's something major happening in the news related to the energy market every few days. When I think about career pathways, I could see myself possibly working in this industry.  
+ I'm passionate about renewable energy, climate change and environmentalism so I wanted to understand more about how the market operates.  
  
### The National Energy Market (NEM)  
The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) makes a number of short and long term forecasts for effective business planning and investment decisions. This project will focus on their short term 5 minute dispatch forecast.  

### Some important details
 The main tools I have used for this analysis are:  
 + Python 3.6, including the following libraries  
 	+ pandas  
 	+ plotly  
 	+ keras with tensorflow as the backend
 + PostgreSQL 9.6.1  
  
This analysis will focus on the NSW NEM region and air temperature at Bankstown Airport (chosen for its somewhat geographical 'average' of Sydney, NSW).

## Understanding the data  
The datasets I have used are quite straightforward. They are:  
+ Demand *(source: AEMO)*  
	+ Settlement date - *settlementdate (timestamp)* - dispatch settlement timestamp observed in 5 minute frequencies  
	+ NEM region - *regionid (character)* - identifier of NEM region  
	+ Demand - *totaldemand (numeric)* - demand for electricity measured in megawatts (MW)  
  
A sample of this data is available in SampleData/Demand.csv  

+ Air temperature *(source: Bureau of Meterology)*  
	+ Time - *index (timestamp)* - air temperature observation timestamp observed in 30 minute frequencies  
	+ Weather Station identifier - *station_id* (character)* - An ID code to identify weather stations around the country  
	+ Temperature - *air_temp (numeric)* - Air temperature measured in degrees Celsius  
  
A sample of this data is available in SampleData/Temperature.csv  
It's worth noting that the air temperature data will not arrive in a clean format as above. Each weather station's data will be in its own file and the usual cleansing, formatting and gap-filling will be needed.  

The scripts where I've loaded raw demand and climate data into PostgreSQL can be found in Scripts/LoadDemand.ipynb and Scripts/LoadClimate.ipynb respectively. I've also included equivalent HTML outputs.   
  
## Exploring the data  
This is what a few days of energy demand in January 2016 looked like:  
![JanuaryDemand](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/DemandSample.PNG)  
  
What we can see from this plot is that on regular days (5th to 11th), the demand averages around the 8,000MW level, which is consistent with the NSW average. There are however, days where the peak exceeds 11,000MW. What could cause such an irregular pattern in demand?  
  
Let's add air temperature as an overlay over that same period:  
![DemandInclTemp](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/TempOverlay.PNG)  

What is evident is that as temperature rose, so did demand. It's not a perfectly aligned because we are comparing the whole of region and the air temperature observed at a single location, but it's pretty close.  
  
The BOM confirms this extreme weather event in their January 2016 summary:  
>"Two heatwaves, over 11-14 and 19-21 January, resulted Observatory Hill recording 8 days above 30 Â°C, well above the average of 3 days and the most hot days since January 1991."  
http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/month/nsw/archive/201601.sydney.shtml  
  
Let's remove the time-series sequencing and plot temperature against demand to understand the relationship independent of time:  
![DemandTemp](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/DemandTemp.PNG)  
  
We can see a clear U-shape forming between electricity demand and temperature. As temperature rises, people use more air conditioning, so demand rises. Simiarly, as temperature falls, people use more heating, so demand rises. There remains a 'sweet spot' of mild temperature between approximately 17 and 21 degrees Celsius where demand is lowest. The plot above has split the points by Weekdays and Weekends to show the comparatively lower demand on weekends due to large sections of the businesses sector not operating.  

The script where I've done my exploratory analysis can be found in Scripts/ExploratoryAnalysis.ipynb. There is also an equivalent HTML output.  

## Approach to modelling  
I started off by developing a predictive model of energy demand, where I only used historical demand as a predictor. This would set a reference point for performance before I included temperature as a second predictor.  

I also wanted try alternative methods of predictions to understand how capable (or limited) the LSTM might be. Each model makes a prediction of the next period, however I used three different methods of making subsequent predictions. These are best illustrated with some simple, visual examples below.  

Let's begin with an 11 period time-series of demand. This is the format of the raw data.  

![Seq1](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/Seq1.PNG)  

The first shift in our thinking needs to re-frame this from a time-series to a series of sequences. Sequences will be equivalent to observations as we train the model.  

If we set a sequence length of 6 periods, then we need to transform this time series into sequence observations as shown below.   

![Seq2](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/Seq2.PNG)  
*How long should a sequence be?*  
It depends on your application, and probably a lot of trial and error.  
  
Once the data is structured in this way, we're ready to start chopping it up to for training and making predictions  

#### 1. Predicting the next value, using known data  
In this type of single-step prediction, sequences of known demand data are used to predict LP (last prediction).  
  
![Seq3](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/Seq3.PNG)  

#### 2. Predicting the entire sequence, using only a starting seed of known data  

![Seq4](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/Seq4.PNG)  

#### 3. Predicting multi-period sequences of a defined length  
In this example, we need to chage some of our starting assumptions slightly. Let's assume our predicting sequence is now 3 periods, and we want to predict a sequence of 2 periods.  
The row 'Demand 1.1' shows that the values in time periods 1 to 3 will be used to predict time period 4. This is a prediction made entirely using known data. Now for the next prediction, 'Demand 1.2', we will use the known values in time periods 2 & 3 and the previously predicted value of time period 4, to predict time period 5. This process will reset as we predict 'Demand 2.1', where a fresh set of known values will be used to make a prediction for time period 6.  

![Seq5](https://github.com/blentley/ForecastingElectricity/blob/master/Screenshots/Seq5.PNG)  
This method of prediction is somewhat of a middle ground between Methods 1 and 2, where the future predictions are more difficult than simply predicting the next step, but not as difficult as predicting the entire sequence using only a starting seed of known values.  
  
For each of these different prediction tyes, the predicted values can still be compared to their known values during model validation.

### Preparing the data  
For convenience, the first step was to aggregate upwards the 5 minute demand data into an average 30 minute demand so that it would easily join to the air temperature data.  

In order to get 

+ Single-step prediction - make a prediction of the next period, and  
+ Multi-step, full sequence prediction -  
+ Multi-step, partial sequence prediction -   
 

### Assembling the model  
I used the LSTM  


The script where I performed the LSTM modelling can be found in Scripts/PredictingDemand.ipynb. There is also an equivalent HTML output.
